# AlphaSense Case Studies

Please find my case study work contained herein. I have followed your submission instructions but also pushed the contents here to a public repository, just in case it's needed.

If you are reading this from the file I submitted directly, just know that everything here is also hosted publicly [here](https://github.com/sdconrox/alphasense_case_study); hence the disclaimer below.

Additionally, I want to note that I completed both options for the case studies. I did this for a few reasons, but mainly because they both looked fun. I also did this to further express my interest in this role, and present the skills that I have honed over the years, especially at my last role, that were applicable to both options.

You will find the work for case study option 1 under the directory named `1`, and the second option under directory `2`.
